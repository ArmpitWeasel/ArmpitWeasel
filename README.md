- 👋 Hi, I’m @ArmpitWeasel
- 👀 I’m trying enter into the world of programming after a brief stint in management and customer relations.
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to get the hang of backtracking and using pygame which is totally new to me.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything (preferably in python as that's the basket most of my eggs are in at the moment). I'm willing to build knowledge in pretty much everything I can. I'm not totally there yet but I hope to be somewhere soon!
- 📫 How to reach me - awdev99@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I really don't like chimpazees
